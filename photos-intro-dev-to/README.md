# Google Photos open-source alternative with React Native

Greetings fellow DEVs! You've probably heard the news about Google Photos
becoming a paid service as of this month. We were eying this date for a while
and been preparing something that we think is kinda cool. Photos UI in all its
glory ported to React Native! Here's a peek:

TODO: GIF

TODO: github, give it a start, there's gonna be Kickstarter , subscribe to mailing list, assume reader stops here

This is still at prototype stage and not ready for prime time, but we wanted to
share early to hear your valuable feedback and hopefully have those of you who
are interested join us to build a community around an ambitious yet nobel goal:

## Ending the reign of the *Big Tech* by building open-source p2p apps!

I don't want to sound arrogant or ungrateful. Truth be told, I personally owe
Big Tech a great deal! The very ability to write these words for example -- I
wouldn't know them if it wasn't for Windows (and me being a nerd)! There was a
version of Windows that probably even Microsoft wasn't aware of:
[MRT Windows](https://www.shouldiremoveit.com/MRT-Windows-XP-Farsi-Interface-Pack-24170-program.aspx)!
(MRT being the initials of the dude who created it)

Been born into a sanctioned country, we didn't have legitimate access to
software such as Windows, but *Mr. MRT* had *BitTorrent* and lots of blank CDs
to cater us :) that's the other piece to the puzzle: although we were in effect
*stealing intellectual property* from Microsoft, a whole generation of
developers was made thanks to (unlawful) democratized access to software.
Instead of the stereotypic *Jihadists* that the world expected, we turned out
quite civilized, many of us who moved abroad are now working for the Big Tech.
A large population of US citizens, meanwhile, couldn't (by enforced law) have
access to Windows and some of them ended up attacking the Capitol this January!

Hopefully the above conveys the importance of free access to software, free
both as in speech and as in beer!
