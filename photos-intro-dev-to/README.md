# Google Photos open-source alternative with React Native

Greetings fellow DEVs! You've probably heard the news about Google Photos
becoming a paid service as of yesterday. We were eying this date for a while
and been preparing something that we think is kinda cool. Photos UI in all its
glory ported to React Native! Here's a peek:

This is still at prototype stage and not ready for prime time, but we wanted to
share early to hear your valuable feedback and hopefully have those of you who
are interested join us to build a community around an ambitious yet nobel goal:

## Ending the reign of the Big Tech by building open-source p2p apps!

I don't want to sound arrogant or ungrateful. Truth be told, I personally owe
Big Tech a great deal! The very ability to write these words, I wouldn't know
them if it wasn't for Windows! There was a version of Windows that probably
even Microsoft wasn't aware of: [Windows MRT](https://www.shouldiremoveit.com/MRT-Windows-XP-Farsi-Interface-Pack-24170-program.aspx)
(with MRT being the initials of the dude who created it)!
